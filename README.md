# Hi there! I'm Bridgett! 👋

I'm a **frontend web developer** who loves building beautiful, responsive websites that make a real impact. 

I'm passionate about the details, from clean, maintainable code to intuitive user experiences. I especially enjoy collaborating across teams to bring ideas to life. People are my favorite part of the work I do.

## What I Currently Do:
- 🧩 **Custom WordPress Development:** I build and maintain **150+ marketing sites**, working on both **custom themes** and **plugins** that get rolled out across our network.  
- ⚙️ **Plugin Development:** Contribute to a **Vue.js-powered WordPress plugin** that powers signup forms across 150+ sites.  
- 🤝 **Collaboration:** Partner closely with **design, SEO, and PPC teams** to ensure sites look great, load fast, and convert effectively.  
- 🌱 **Mentorship & Leadership:** Manage a front-end **internship program** and mentor **junior developers** as they grow their skills and confidence.  
- ✨ **Accessibility Advocacy:** I believe great design should be for everyone, and I keep accessibility in mind from the start of every project.
